# CSCI 213 Lab 10: Working with Git

## __Author__: Aaron Marker

This  is  the  Git  lab  for  CSCI  213  Software  Development.   One  class  was  added,  Car.java,
which extends the abstract Vehicle class.  The Car class contains the following:
* two instance variables :grinning:
* a parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables :laughing:
* getters for the instance varaibles in this class :slightly_smiling_face:
* the toString method :wink:
* the equals method :blush:
* a copy method :upside_down_face:
